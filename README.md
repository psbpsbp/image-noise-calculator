# minecraft-noise-calculator
A minecraft noise calculator and texturepack maker

Use visualizer.py to see how some textures will look like and then convert it to a texturepack using texturepacker.py,

visualizer.py imports noise calculation variables from texturepacker.py so you'll need to change them there

### When using texturepacker.py
It will replicate all directories from the specified folder and copy any none-png files.

You still have to provide a pack.mcmeta for the texturepack to work
